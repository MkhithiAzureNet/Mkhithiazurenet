# 📁 Case: MTU SweetSpot — Intermittent Drops Solved by 1400 MTU

## 🧠 Scenario

Client on Gigabit FTTH reports stable speedtest results (near line-rate), but experiences intermittent freezes during online gaming, video calls, and general browsing. No packet loss visible in short pings or speedtests. Issue persists across devices and operating systems.

## 🔍 Root Cause Summary

- Classic symptoms of upstream packet fragmentation
- `ping -f -l 1436` command fails, confirming path MTU mismatch
- Standard MTU setting (1500) exceeds the allowable size on the client's WAN path
- Silent drop events never surface in basic diagnostic tools like speedtest or ICMP 32-byte tests

## 🧪 Diagnostic Workflow

Command used:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8 -f -l 1436
