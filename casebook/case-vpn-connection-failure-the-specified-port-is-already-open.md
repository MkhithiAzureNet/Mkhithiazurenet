## 🧠 Incident Summary

User encountered VPN connection failure with the error:

> ❌ “The specified port is already open”

Despite correct credentials and protocol selection, the VPN client failed to initialize the session—implying a **conflict at the TCP/IP stack or WAN Miniport level**.

## 🔍 RCA Breakdown

### 🔧 1. Symptom Interpretation

- **Likely port**: `TCP 1723` (used by PPTP)
- Error caused by:
  - Socket leftover from previous VPN session
  - Conflicting local process owning the port
  - Driver (Miniport) fault or hang
  - Registry-bound port exhaustion

### 🧰 2. Port Ownership Detection

Used `netstat` and `taskkill` to isolate PID:

```cmd
netstat -aon | findstr :1723
taskkill /F /PID [found_PID]
